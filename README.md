# Livestock Food Plant Malfunction Reporting GUI
## This software GUI allows factory employees to report malfunctions in a livestock food plant. The GUI is easy to use and can be accessed by any employee with a computer or mobile device.

To report a malfunction, the employee simply selects the type of malfunction from a drop-down list and then provides additional information, such as the location of the malfunction, the date and time of the malfunction, and a description of the malfunction. The employee can also attach photos or videos of the malfunction.

Once the report is submitted, it is sent to a designated manager for review. The manager can then take action to fix the malfunction.

The reports are also exported to an Excel spreadsheet, which can be used to track malfunctions over time and identify trends. This information can be used to improve the safety and efficiency of the factory.
